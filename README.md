<h1>Hello, I am blazingkyuubii!</h1>

<p>I have been working with programming languages since my 1st year of college. I have done projects such as Web Development, Mobile App Development, Database Management, Game Development, and many more cool stuff! I'm still learning lots of programming, even the languages I mainly use!</p>
<p>If you're curious, my username came from the anime series Naruto. You know.. the Kyuubi... it's blazing..</p>
